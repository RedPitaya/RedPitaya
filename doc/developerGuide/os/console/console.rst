.. _console:

*************
Debug console
*************

The debug console can be used to follow the boot process:

1. FSBL (if debug mode is enabled)

   The serial console can also be used to see the output
   of other bare metal applications, for example the memory test.

2. U-Boot

   During the boot process U-Boot will show status and debug information.

   After FSBL starts U-Boot, there is a 3 second delay
   before U-Boot starts the Linux kernel.
   If during this time a key is pressed,
   U-boot will stop the boot process
   and give the user access to its shell.

3. Linux console

   During the boot process Linux will show status and debug information.

   When ``systemd`` reaches ``multi-user.target`` a login prompt will appear.

      User name: ``root``
      Password: ``root``

.. note::

   For STEMlab 125-14 you need additional USB to microUSB cable,
   for STEMlab 125-10 additional serial to USB adapter.

Connect your Red Pitaya and PC with micro USB B to USB A cable and follow the instructions for your OS.

Windows
-------

Download and install the `FTD driver <http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm>`_ to your PC. After installation, a 
new COM port will appear in the Device Manager you can use in Hyperterminal or another terminal utility to connect to 
Red Pitaya.

Linux

There is broad support for USB to serial converters in the Linux kernel,
so in most cases the converter will be detected soon after connecting it.

You can see the driver output in the kernel log using ``dmesg``:

.. code-block:: none
   :emphasize-lines: 11

   $ dmesg
   ...
   [95074.784075] usb 1-2.4.3: new full-speed USB device number 20 using ehci-pci

   [95074.891157] usb 1-2.4.3: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB0

The first board connected to your PC will create a device named ``/dev/ttyUSB0``.
If **N** USB to serial devices are connected, they will appear as
``/dev/ttyUSBn`` where **n** in in **{0, 1, ..., N-1}**.
To access this devices programs should be run with ``sudo``.

~~~~~~~~~~~
``minicom``
~~~~~~~~~~~

Minicom is a text-based modem control and terminal emulation program .
It is commonly used for setting up a remote serial console.

To configure ``minicom`` use the ``-s`` option.

.. code-block:: shell-session

   sudo minicom -s

A configuration menu will open.

.. code-block:: none

* Bps/Par/Bits: ``115200 8N1`` (baud rate, byte length, parity and stop bits)
* Hardware/Software Flow Control: No (flow control should be disabled)

   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

``minicom`` requires some special ``Control+a`` key sequences to operate.
Please see the `minicom manual <https://linux.die.net/man/1/minicom>`_ for details.

~~~~~~~~~~
``screen``
~~~~~~~~~~

GNU ``screen`` is in general a terminal multiplexer.
It also supports connecting to a serial console,
and provides syntax to configure the serial connection
baud rate, byte length, parity and flow control, ...

Compared to ``minicom`` it provides better fonts,
better support for terminal window re-sizing, ...

.. code-block:: shell-session

   $ sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB1 115200 cs8

Similar to ``minicom``, ``screen`` requires some special ``Control+a`` key sequences to operate.
Please see the `screen manual <https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html>`_ for details.
