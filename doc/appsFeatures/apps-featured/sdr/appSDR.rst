1. connect Tx of SDR transciver module to Red Pitaya OUT1
2. connect Rx of SDR ransciver module to Red Pitaya IN1 (notice this cable has a transformer)
3. connect control cable from SDR transceiver to Red Pitaya

identify pin with arrow and connect the cable as on the image bellow.

4. Make sure jumper is set as shown on image above.
5. Connect ethernet cable
6. Connect Red Pitaya to power supply 5V 2A
7. Connect antenna

8. Connect SDR transceiver to 13.8V 3A power supply

.. note::
	
	STEMlab SDR transceiver module should be powered by DC 13.8V Power Supply that can provide at least 3 A of constant power. 
	Make sure that is turned off and then use DC power cord with Anderson Power Pole™ connector **(9)** to connect it with module. 
	RED wire is positive (+) while BLACK wire is negative (-), double check to not mix the colours or polarity! 
	Don’t turn on the power supply yet.
	
9. Turn on power supply

10. Put STEMlab in SDR mode:

	* Make sure your computer is connected to same local area network as STEMlab 
	* Open your WEB browser and connect to your STEMlab (http://redpitaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickStart/first.html)

STEMlab is now ready to connet with Power SDR.
