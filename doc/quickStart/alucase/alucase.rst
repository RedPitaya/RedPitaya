    Interior of the Red Pitaya Aluminum Case.
    

On the Interior, there is a block located in the upper part of the housing (right)
which passes the heat to the housing, hence the entire case acts as a heat sink.

On the lower part there are fits to a few air vents (left).

Apertures in the case expose connections to the expansion ports **E1** and **E2**.
