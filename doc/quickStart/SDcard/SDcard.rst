**********
Background
**********

A Red Pitaya SD card contains two partitions:

1. 128MB FAT contains the **ecosystem**

   * boot files: FSBL, FPGA images, U-Boot, Linux kernel
   * Red Pitaya API libraries and header files
   * Red Pitaya web applications, scripts, tools
   * customized Nginx web server

2. ~4GB Ext4 contains the **OS**

   * Ubuntu/Debian OS
   * various libraries
   * network setup customization
   * systemd services customization

Most of Red Pitaya source code translates into the ecosystem,
Therefore this is updated more often.
The OS is changed less frequently.

.. note::

   You can find older and development Red Pitaya OS images and Ecosystem zipfiles
   on our `download server <http://downloads.redpitaya.com/downloads/>`_.

.. note::

   A list of new features, bugfixes and known bugs for each Red Pitaya release
   can be found in our `CHANGELOG <https://github.com/RedPitaya/RedPitaya/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md>`_.


#############################
Upgrading Red Pitaya software
#############################

Instead of writing the whole SD card image,
it is possible to upgrade only the ecosystem.

*********************
Web interface upgrade
*********************

At boot Red Pitaya checks for software updates,
and alerts the user if a new release is available.
Users can also check for updates manually.

#. Open Red Pitaya desktop using your WEB browser.

#. Click on the **upgrade alert** or on the **ecosystem version label** in bottom right corner.

   .. image:: SDcard_upgrade_desktop.png

#. Select ecosystem version and start OS updater

   .. image:: SDcard_update_manager.png

#. Follow the steps in the OS updater app in order to install new OS.
   
.. note::
   
   OS upgrade might cause your Red Pitaya desktop to freeze for a few minutes.

**************
Manual upgrade
**************

A manual upgrade allows you to fix a corrupted SD card image
(if only the FAT partition is corrupted) or to install
older, newer or custom ecosystem zip files.

#. Download a zip file from our `download server <http://downloads.redpitaya.com/downloads/>`_.

#. Insert SD card into card reader.

#. Delete all files from the FAT partition.
   Use ``Shift + Delete`` to avoid placing files
   into a trash bin on the same partition.

#. Extract the ecosystem zip file contents onto the now empty partition.

If you wish to keep wireless settings skip deleting the next files:

* ``wpa_supplicant.conf``
* ``hostapd.conf``
