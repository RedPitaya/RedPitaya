What do I need before I start?
##############################

The following essential items needed to start are already included
in each STEM kits available from our `WEB store <http://redpitaya.com/#products>`_:

* 5 V / 2 A micro USB power supply,
* 4GB (up to 32GB) Class 10 micro SD card with pre-loaded Red Pitaya OS,
* Ethernet cable.

Additional Required Items not supplied with the STEM kits:

* computer with internet browser (Chrome browser recommended),
* router with DHCP server enabled and access to the internet.

.. note::

   Red Pitaya should not be powered from a power supply that is <2A
   or has a very thin power wires, since this will reflect in abnormal behavior of the device,
   causing re-boots and network disconnections.
   Same problem might appear if Red Pitaya is powered directly from USB on a PC or HUB
   that cannot provide enough power or when using bad powering cable.

.. note::

   **Windows 7/8** users should install `Bonjour Print Services <http://redpitaya.com/bonjour>`_,
   otherwise access to ``*.local`` addresses will not work.

   **Windows 10** already supports mDNS and DNS-SD,
   so there is no need to install additional software.

.. note::

   Before STEM kits were introduced all Red Pitaya kits were shipped with a blank SD cards.
   If you have such a kit, please follow the steps in the :ref:`Prepare SD card <prepareSD>` 
   paragraph to properly load Red Pitaya OS to your SD card.

.. note::

   Access to the internet is required only when:

   * upgrading Red Pitaya OS,
   * installing applications from the marketplace,
   * unlocking applications.
