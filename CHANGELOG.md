# Release 0.98

FPGA (mercury):
- fixed bugs causing unreliable reads from oscilloscope, logic analyzer buffer
- moved burst mode finite/infinite control into period repetitions register
- restructured arbitrary signal generator, so periodic and burst mode are separate modules
- added digital loopback between generator and oscilloscope (this is for test purposes)
- added bit controlling if trigger will restart a running burst or not
- trigger holdoff was removed from oscilloscope, instead it should be placed into
  a common trigger module accepting various trigger inputs and handling timing,
  while oscilloscope and logic analyzer triggers only handle values,
  at least this is the idea

- updated to Ubuntu 16.04.3

Jupyter:
- using `ctypes` array for generator/oscilloscope data buffer

# Release 0.96 RC?

Application changes:
- partial cleanup of copied JS/CSS code and images

# Release 0.96 RC1

System Changes:
- recoded Bazaar related Makefiles, instead of cross compilation, a native
  compiler root system is used, running inside an ARM QEMU virtualized
  environment, this avoids library version issues, but emulation is slow
- top Makefiles are now split into a system Makefile.x86, which requires x86
  to run tools like Vivado and a user space Makefile used to compile
  applications (Bazaar, web apps, SCPI, API, ...)
- updated Nginx from version 1.5.3 to the latest 1.10.0
- removed NGINX patches
- updated Lua Nginx from version v0.8.7 to the latest v0.10.2
- updated Websocket++ from version 0.5.0 to a slightly newer 0.7.0,
  and provided a patch for an issue triggered by kernel update to 4.4
- removed Buildroot, lately it was only used to provide libraries at compile
  time, now Debian libraries are used directly
- removing SDK, since it was not maintained, now it is possible to compile all
  user space code directly on Red Pitaya
- removed some deprecated/duplicated source code
- Vivado/U-Boot/Linux were updated to xilins-v2016.2
- the Linaro compiler is no longer needed, ARMHF compiler is now part of Vivado SDK

OS changes:
- the OS was switched from Debian Jessie to Ubintu 16.04,
  the main reason for the switch is access to Launchpad PPA
- OS image building scripts are now a bit cleaner with separation into
  generic Ubuntu settings, network and Red Pitaya specific settings

Network:
- the network setup was entirely recoded using systemd specific tools
- zeroconf support was added
- the network setup is now properly documented in NETWORK.md

FPGA2:
- `fpga2` project was added, which is used by `api2` and the LA application
- the project is rewritten in SystemVerilog mostly to make the code shorter
- instead of storing samples in a short buffer, Xilinx DMA is used to copy data into the main memory
- more thought is (should be) given to modules with Linux kernel drivers available

API2:
- UIO is used to divide the memory space into separate segments each controlled by a separate driver
- device tree overlays are used to handle loading various FPGA images, this is not yet ready for public use

Application changes:
- Makefile changes so applications can be compiled directly on Red Pitaya
- removing 'libjpeg' sources from spectrum analyzer applications and instead
  using the 'libjpeg-turbo' Debian system library

Network manager
/SCPI/Wyliodrin managers

- user is now able to upgrade Red Pitaya OS directly from the WEB browser
  rewriting complete SD card image is now only necesary in case of Debian/Ubuntu changes (usually systemd and network related)
- Red Pitaya desktop was improved so it is more simple to use and also provides better support for tablets and smartphones
- browser detection was added that suggest users to install or upgrade to recommended version
- online/offline detection was added so that user knows if Red Pitaya can access the internet / if it is possible use some features that requires internet connection
- switching between contributed and official applications doesnâ€™t causes problems anymore
- system crashes reports with debug information can now be sent to Red Pitaya team on user request
- Feedback app - enables user to send feedback our support with attached information about Red Pitaya OS, computer OS & browser

# Release 0.94 RC24

Changes:
- libstdc++.so was removed from /opt/redpitaya/lib, this was made possible
  by fixing C++ application Makefile-s, some were using g++ while also linking

## Changes

### FPGA
* reorganized `fpga` directory structure
* removed Vivado project, instead added non project mode TCL scripts
* added Vivado TCL scripts for creating a project (used for migrating to newer tool versions)
* updated Vivado to newest version 2015.2
* fixed an ASG issue which could result in a slightly wrong frequency and slightly distorted signals
* restructured `rtl/red_pitaya_analog.v` to move IO and PLL related code (device specific code) to the top module
* connected XADC to AXI using the Xilinx provided Wizard, which allows us to use the IIO Linux driver with it
* LED[0] is now a normal software controllable output
* test benches were updated, so they compile now, and some were also run and used, there were no significant changes to functionality

### Device tree
* updated to Xilinx version 2015.1
* changed patch structure, to take advantage of device tree language features
* added nodes for XADC
* added nodes for `LED8` and `LED9`

### U-Boot
* updated to Xilinx version 2015.2
* patched so it executes additional code (from script files) after I2C EEPROM configuration is executed and before running the Linux kernel (porting done by *Pavel Demin*)
* scripts were added to run either Buildroot from initramfs or Debian from EXT4

### Linux kernel
* updated to Xilinx version 2015.1 (porting done by *Pavel Demin*)
* updated Wireless driver, copied from Raspberry PI

### OS
* in addition to Buildroot, Debian Jessie OS is now supported (porting done by *Pavel Demin*)
* discovery was rewritten from lengthy C code into a short BASH script

### Toolchain
* for bare metal applications the toolchain from Vivado 2015.2 SDK is used
* for Linux user space Linaro 2014.11 is used
* ARMHF ABI is used for better compatibility with modern Linux distributions, breaking compatibility with older ARMEL applications

### Web applications
* existing free applications were recompiled for ARMHF, and are still also compatible with ARMEL for older ecosystems
* new Oscilloscope+Generator and Spectrum analyzer were added
* fixed support for applications loading their own FPGA bitstream images

### Other applications
* Wyliodrin was ported to Debian on Red Pitaya

### APIs
* the prefered API for XADC is now the Linux IIO driver
* the prefered API for LED[9:8] is now the Linux LED driver
* removed some dependencies to `libredpitaya`, will probably be deprecated, since most functionality is present in `librp`

## Known issues

### FPGA
* possible timing issues
* poorly written test benches

### U-Boot
* there is no simple method to remove 3 second boot wait

### Linux kernel, device tree
* Linux kernel could not be updated to the latest Xilinx version 2015.2.01, due to changes to the Ethernet and USB subsystems, which caused issues

### OS
* wireless is broken on Buildroot, and will probably only be futher maintained on Debian/Ubuntu
* The scrip for detecting the WiFi driver and reconfiguring the AP config file is not able to write the file, so only one chip is supported without manually modifying `hostapd.conf`

### Other applications
* SCPI server is poorly tested and the documentation is old



# Release 0.93 (30 April 2015)

## Changes

### FPGA
* added burst mode to ASG (arbitrary signal generator)

* CDC (clock domain crossing) moved from `bus_clk_bridge.v` into PS (processing system)
* registered read data bus for all slaves on the custom system bus
* removed unconnected SPI interface from PS
* removed bench support from Vivado project
