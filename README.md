# How to start programming Red Pitaya or developing your own applications?
There are several ways to program / develop with Red Pitaya.

1. Remote control / programming
   Remote control can be done by using most popular rapid prototyping development tools
   MATLAB, LABview, SCILAB or Python remotely. There are [several examples](https://redpitaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/appsFeatures/remoteControl/remoteControl.html) available.

2. Programing Red Pitaya directly from WEB browser / Python
   Red Pitaya can be programmed in Python directly from the WEB browser using [Jupyter](https://redpitaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/appsFeatures/jupyter/Jupyter.html?highlight=jupyter).

3. C/C++ programming
   RedPitaya hardware features can be easily accessed through C APIs. Many starting examples are available at this [link](https://redpitaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/appsFeatures/remoteControl/remoteControl.html#examples).

4. FPGA programming
   Information on how to copile Red Pitaya open source FPGA code is [here](https://redpitaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developerGuide/fpga.html).

5. Creating own WEB applications
   Instructions on how to create your own Red Pitaya WEB applications can be found [here](https://redpitaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developerGuide/software/webApps.html).


# How to interface Red Pitaya with other hardware or sensors?
Beside fast analog inputs and outputs Red Pitaya comes with an extension connector that enables users to interface with other hardware devices or sensors over standard i2c, UART, SPI interfaces or additional slow analog inputs and outputs and digital GPIOs.

There are two main extension possibilities:

1. Using already available sensor extension module by RedPitaya
   Sensors extension module provides direct connection to GroveSensors (e.g. Temperature sensor, Motion sensor,Touch sensor, Button, Switch, Tilt, Potentiometer, Light sensor, Air quality sensor, Vibration sensor, Moisture sensor, Water sensor, Alcohol sensor, Barometer not supported at the moment, Sound sensor, UV sensor, Accelerometer, Relay). Sensor extension module also provide compatibility with arduino extension modules. More examples and information can be found at this [link](https://redpitaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/appsFeatures/jupyter/Jupyter.html?highlight=jupyter).

2. Creating own add on module that connects to extension connector
