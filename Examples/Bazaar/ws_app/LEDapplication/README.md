LED example application

This is example of web application that control LEDs.
It use WebSocket interface and light version of rp_sdk.
Basically gzip is off, so it is not depend on cryptopp.

It needs libjson (tested with 7.6.1).
Please put it to libjson folder - see makefile in local rp_sdk folder.
